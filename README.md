# pyroradio

PyroRadio.com is a online radio station using PHP and wordpresss. It was the first website I developed for production. My co-worker asked me to develop the site as he heard I done web dev as a hobby. At the time I didn't know PHP and had never used wordpress. I learnt quickly and my co-worker loves the finished result.
